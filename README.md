# Moovix

## API : [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

## Step 1: Start the Metro server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

Install dependencies:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn install
```

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
npx pod-install
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:
